## My Data Science Projects


### Predicted Lending Club® Loan Default Risk (Prediction)                                                                              
*	Data cleaning and feature engineering on large Lending Club® loan data (122K+ rows, 145 variables)
*	Predicted default risk and identified important features using Logistic Reg, Random Forest, CART, and XGBoost
*	XBGoost and Logistic Reg can be used to predict loan default with high accuracy (test ROC>0.96, F1-score > 0.83)

### Sentiment Prediction and Restaurant Recommendation using Yelp® Reviews (NLP/Prediction/Recommender)
*	NLP and TF-IDF on large Yelp restaurant review data (Las Vegas 4600 restaurants, 210K users, 444K reviews)
*	Predicted perfect sentiment (rating 5 vs. 1-4) using review texts and Logistic Regression (test ROC 0.92, F1-score 0.84)
*	Recommended restaurants using ratings, texts, and Latent-Factor (Matrix Factorization) Collaborative Filtering 
*	Models can be used to predict customer sentiment and recommend restaurants based on review history and text inputs

### Recommended Movies Using Item-Item Collaborative Filtering on Movie Ratings (Recommender)                                         
*	Converted 100,000 movie ratings into user-movie rating matrix (943 users, 1,682 movies)
*	Predicted new ratings using item-item cosine similarity and nearest neighbors (MSE 0.98/MAE 0.81 for rating 1-5)
*	Model can be used to recommend new movies to users based on their rating history on other movies
